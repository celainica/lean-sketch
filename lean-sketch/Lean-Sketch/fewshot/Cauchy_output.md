**Lemma 1 (Fixed-Point Congruence):** Let $\alpha$ be a finite set and $p$ be a prime. Let $\sigma$ be a permutation of $\alpha$ such that $\sigma^p$ is the identity permutation. Then the number of fixed points of $\sigma$ is congruent to the cardinality of $\alpha$ modulo $p$.
$$ |\{ a \in \alpha \mid \sigma(a) = a \}| \equiv |\alpha| \pmod p $$
*Proof.* The permutation $\sigma$ partitions the set $\alpha$ into disjoint orbits. The size of any orbit must divide the order of the group generated by $\sigma$, which itself must divide $p$ since $\sigma^p = 1$. As $p$ is prime, the possible sizes for any orbit are 1 or $p$.

An element $a \in \alpha$ is a fixed point if and only if its orbit has size 1. Let $k$ be the number of fixed points (i.e., orbits of size 1), and let $m$ be the number of orbits of size $p$. The total number of elements in $\alpha$ is the sum of the sizes of all orbits, so we have:
$$ |\alpha| = k \cdot 1 + m \cdot p $$
Taking this equation modulo $p$, we find that $|\alpha| \equiv k \pmod p$. This completes the proof of the lemma.

**Proof of Theorem:**

Let $G$ be a finite group and $p$ be a prime such that $p$ divides the order of $G$, denoted $|G|$. We aim to find an element $x \in G$ with order $p$.

Consider the set $S$ of all vectors (or tuples) of length $p$ with elements from $G$ whose components multiply to the identity element, $1$:
$$ S = \{ (g_1, g_2, \dots, g_p) \in G^p \mid g_1 g_2 \cdots g_p = 1 \} $$
The cardinality of this set is $|S| = |G|^{p-1}$. To see this, we can freely choose the first $p-1$ components $g_1, \dots, g_{p-1}$, and the last component $g_p$ is then uniquely determined by the equation $g_p = (g_1 g_2 \cdots g_{p-1})^{-1}$. Since we are given that $p \mid |G|$ and $p$ is prime (so $p \ge 2$, meaning $p-1 \ge 1$), it follows that $p$ also divides $|G|^{p-1}$. Thus, $|S|$ is divisible by $p$.

Now, let's define a permutation $\sigma$ on the set $S$ by cyclically shifting the components of a vector:
$$ \sigma(g_1, g_2, \dots, g_p) = (g_2, g_3, \dots, g_p, g_1) $$
This operation maps elements of $S$ to elements of $S$. If $g_1 g_2 \cdots g_p = 1$, then we can conjugate by $g_1$ to see that $g_2 \cdots g_p g_1 = g_1^{-1}(g_1 g_2 \cdots g_p)g_1 = g_1^{-1}(1)g_1 = 1$. Thus, the resulting vector is also in $S$.

Applying the permutation $\sigma$ for $p$ times will return any vector to its original state, so $\sigma^p$ is the identity permutation on $S$. We can now apply Lemma 1 to the set $S$ and the permutation $\sigma$. Since $p \mid |S|$, we have $|S| \equiv 0 \pmod p$. By the lemma, the number of fixed points of $\sigma$ must also be congruent to 0 modulo $p$.
$$ |\{ v \in S \mid \sigma(v) = v \}| \equiv |S| \equiv 0 \pmod p $$
This means the number of fixed points in $S$ is a multiple of $p$.

We can easily identify one fixed point: the vector $v_0 = (1, 1, \dots, 1)$, since its product is $1^p=1$ and it is invariant under cyclic shifts. Since the total number of fixed points is a non-zero multiple of $p$ (which is greater than 1), there must exist at least one other fixed point. Let $v$ be a fixed point in $S$ such that $v \neq v_0$.

The condition that $v$ is a fixed point, $\sigma(v) = v$, means that $(g_1, g_2, \dots, g_p) = (g_2, g_3, \dots, g_p, g_1)$. Comparing components, we find $g_1=g_2$, $g_2=g_3$, ..., and so on. This implies that all components of the vector $v$ must be identical. So, $v$ must be of the form $(x, x, \dots, x)$ for some element $x \in G$.

Now we analyze the properties of this element $x$:
1.  Since $v = (x, x, \dots, x)$ is in the set $S$, the product of its components must be 1. This means $x^p = 1$.
2.  Since $v \neq v_0$, we have $(x, x, \dots, x) \neq (1, 1, \dots, 1)$, which implies that $x \neq 1$.

We have found an element $x \in G$ satisfying both $x^p = 1$ and $x \neq 1$. Since $p$ is a prime number, these two conditions together imply that the order of $x$ is exactly $p$. This concludes the proof.
